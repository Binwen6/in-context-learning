## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/in-context-learning.git
   cd in-context-learning


2. **Adding Your Experiments**

Each member should create a personal directory at the root level of the repository:  `mkdir your_name`


Inside your directory, you can organize:
- code
- checkpoints
- logs
- readme / notes
- visualizations

Example:

## 🧠 Git Commands for Beginners

### Check current status
`git status`

### Stage specific file
`git add yourfile.py`

### Commit your changes
`git commit -m "Add new experiment in alice/run1"`

### Pull latest changes from remote (important before pushing!)
`git pull origin main`

### Push your commits to the remote repository
`git push origin main`

### Create and switch to a new branch (if needed)
`git checkout -b branch-name`

### Switch back to main branch
`git checkout main`

> 💡 Always pull (git pull origin main) before pushing your changes to avoid conflicts.
